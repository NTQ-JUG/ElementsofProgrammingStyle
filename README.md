# The Elements of Programming Style

1. Write clearly - don't be too clever.
2. Tell what you mean, simply and clearly.
3. Use library functions whenever feasible.
4. Avoid too many temporary variables.
5. Write clearly - don't sacrifice clarity for "efficiency".
6. Let the machine do the dirty work.
7. Replace repetitive expressions by calls to common functions.
8. Paratherize to avoid ambiguity.
9. Choose variables names that won't be confused.
10. Avoid unnecessary branches.
11. If a logical expression is hard to understand, try transforming it.
12. Chose a data representation that makes the problem simple.
13. Write first in easy-tou-understand pseudo language; then translate into whatever lanuage you have to use.
14. Modularize. Use procedures and functions.
15. Avoid gotos completely if you can keep the program readable.
16. Don't path bad code - rewrite it.
17. Write and test a big program in small pieces.
18. Use recursive procedures for recursively-defined data structures.
19. Test input for plausibility and validity.
20. Make sure input doesn't violate the limits of the programs.
